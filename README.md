# 🐀 Rat (Go)

I couldn't get BAT to work for me - so I'm creating my own simplified version as a go binary

## 🚀 Features

- Colourful print out of a text file 

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Go] To compile the code to a binary

## 📁 Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jonathon-chew/Rat.git
   cd Rat 
   ```

2. Compile the binary:

    `go build .`

## 📂 Output

Pass in any number of files and the output will pretty print the file

## 🧠 Notes

This is currently a work in progress with a few inovations planned for the future.
Issues will be tracked in Github issues.
